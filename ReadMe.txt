Hello there!

My name is Bohdan Skrypka. I'm a Software \ Science engineer.

This block of information will be about science things I worked on. Some of my investigations and works 
you can find here mapped by folders (directions):
- approximation-schema-of-zeilema
- transportation equatation - read in Russian or translate

=============================
Warning: If you not don't know what the difference between approximation and interpolation - please, stop reading right here,
 that's the simples thing you will read about down below!

If you're looking for something - you'll find that, just take your time.
I'm just kidding, if you want to know smth new from these folders - please, enjoy your reading here.

1) Mathematical-physics:

Here you can find and read about few thing from Math. Physics, approximation algorightms I worked on in 2017-2018 years.

1. Implicit approximation of the right-hand side based on explicit schemes of the 2nd, 3rd order.
2. Monotonization of solutions by choosing the smoothest template for approximating the time derivative.
3. Construction of an implicit iterative difference scheme for a one-dimensional transport equation.
4. Solution of the transport equation.
5. Construction of an Implicit Iterative Difference Scheme for the Homogeneous Transport Equation.
6. approximation schema of zeilema - approximation based on 5 points to simplify your curve.

------------------ SAMPLE HERE -------------------------------
1. To guess and build an unknown function from the nothing you need at least smth to know.
2. The most common situation - I have a range of points with data (local measurements of smth).

3. Could be that will be useful to you in your software. Zeilema schema propose you to have algorithm with approximation 
(almost impossible find internet references on the algorithm, I fould few marks in Russian Academy of Science publications).
